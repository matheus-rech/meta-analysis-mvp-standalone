# Review guidelines for templates/

- `report_template.Rmd` must render with parameters from session: project_name, session_path, effect_measure, analysis_model
- Prefer HTML output in CI; PDF/Word optional locally
- Include plots and bias results when available; remain robust when artifacts are missing
